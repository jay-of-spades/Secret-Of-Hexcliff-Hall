          <p>
            <span class="phrase"></span>
            <span class="phrase">Today is the day you inherited that key fob. </span>
            <span class="phrase">You have no idea why of all his nieces and nephews, Uncle Matt chose you.</span>
            <span class="phrase"> But he did.</span>
            <span class="phrase">You've wandered for quite a while, trying to find the road that would lead to the
              estate.
            </span>
            <span class="phrase">It wasn't that difficult...</span>
            <span class="phrase">not at all.</span>
            <span class="phrase">You simply had to accept that the only way through was by taking the dirt road, then
              the
              swamps. </span>
            <span class="phrase">And get there you did.</span>

            <br><br>
            <span class="phrase">The house itself, it seemed, offered little but the stench of decaying timber—</span>
            <span class="phrase">a scent
              one would fervently wish to evade.</span>

            <span class="phrase">As you cross the platform leading to the mansion's creaking porch,</span>
            <span class="phrase">you become aware of
              the
              oppressive force that is this house.</span>
            <span class="phrase">A visible, uncompromising, and suffocating force.</span>
            <span class="phrase">

              Yet, these
              thoughts remain speculative for now.
            </span>
            <span class="phrase">

              After all, the mist enshrouding the house might simply be pollen—
            </span>
            <span class="phrase">
              a
              strange, violet mist, heavy with a musty, rotting odor.
            </span>

            <br><br>
            <span class="phrase">

              The urge to flee nearly overwhelms you.
            </span>
            <span class="phrase">Could it be
              perilous?
            </span>
            <span class="phrase">
              Possibly toxic?
            </span>
            <span class="phrase">
              Or even cursed?
            </span>
            <span class="phrase">
              Despite these fears, the dire financial burdens and gravely ill
              loved ones compel a surge of bravery from within.
            </span>
            <span class="phrase">
              Life, as the saying goes, nudges you to confront the
              challenge.
            </span>
            <span class="phrase">
              To advance with determination.
            </span>
            <span class="phrase">
              To uncover whether there's anything worth salvaging in this
              accursed estate.
            </span>

            <br><br>
            <span class="phrase">
              Thus, you find yourself there,
            </span>
            <span class="phrase">
              turning the dilapidated, corroded door handle,
            </span>
            <span class="phrase">
              embarking on
              what may well be the most treacherous venture of your life.
            </span>
            <span class="phrase">
              All to glean the remnants of glory and wealth
              that Hexcliff Hall may yet reveal.
            </span>
            <span class="phrase">
              But truly,
            </span>

            <br><br>
            <span class="phrase">
              Are you prepared for what lies ahead?
            </span>
